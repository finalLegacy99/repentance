                <p>No, uneventfully it is the Cleric of the Deoch Fellowship, Srgious. A priest with jet black hair; glowing blue eyes, and brown skin enveloped in a desert garb. Unlike most aislings in his order, he wields a sword that ironically symbolizes the post he left ages ago. Now he returns to the temple where it all started, battered by the experiences he’s faced up to this day.</p>

                <p>“My child… Danaan weeps with you. This world is hard, but she gave you the tools to navigate it. Use them.” Deoch says softly as Srgious feels the cracks in his spark dissipating. “Chadul may have his tendrils in the stations meant to protect and guide you, but the spark is a gift of many things. Darkness may hide light from your vision to make you believe it is gone, but that is all it can do.” Deoch releases the aisling and he floats softly to the ground. </p>

                  Srgious takes a moment to himself as he looks upon the statue of Danaan housed in Deoch’s shrine. He notices how it differs from the other statues in other temples, the clutched shawl next to her chest, her heart. Invoking the memories of her sacrifice and the spark that arose from it. So much strife and discord brought about by Chadul that she had to relinquish her own life to quell, while Deoch stood idly by while his fathers madness corrupted the world. But now his eyes are open, now that his love is gone, because of his inaction. The cleric wonders if Deoch knew of the stakes beforehand, would he have acted differently, would he have sacrificed himself for Danaan, would it even have come to that?
                </p>

                <p>
                  “What do I have to sacrifice?” Srgious asks aloud, pondering his own problems and his own fight for the light in this world.

                <p>“As long as you ask irrelevant questions, that do not come from your spark, shall we continue this… game.'' Deoch says, still unmoved. Srgious’s stance straightens, another big breath is taken. “You… come into my temple, and pray to me, and ask… me, what do I want? Am I real?” Deoch says. Both the priest and the Deity’s eyes stay fixed upon each other. Srgious’s eyes tighten into a sneer.</p>

                <p>“Well you will have to forgive my skepticism and confusion, as this is the first time one of my many, many, countless prayers before hasn't gone unanswered.” Srgious states.</p>

                <p>“Your half-assed prayers.” Deoch corrects.</p>
                
                <p>“Excuse you?” Srgious’s expression turns wild.</p>
              
                <p>“Prayers you didn’t mean, prayers you rushed, none of them came from your heart and spark, but this one, I felt your spark breaking, you were on the brink of sending yourself to Sgrios.”</p>

                <p>“Then where in Danaan’s name have you been to let me reach this point?” Srgious’s temperament boils over, as tears. Suddenly Srgious feels his spark compacting as he slowly falls to his needs, his vision begins to fade. He looks to Deoch, and sees his left arm beyond the flames, and his hand crushing air. Then the realization hits him as firm as Deoch’s grip does.</p>

                <p>“You. Dare, use that name, in my presence, so carelessly?” Deoch’s tone grows stern. Srgious’s chest lifts him into the air as Deoch slightly raises his arm. Srgious’s eyes close, and his head falls backward, as the aisling relents, accepting his fate. Darkness engulfs him.</p>

                <p>“What is it you seek for my child?” </p>

                <p>“Okay, well. I’ve come to you today to ask, didn’t think you’d answer, but I came to ask, what am I to do? I am branded like a criminal for minor alterations by this corrupt autocracy, baring me from the positions that Temuair holds dear. I want to at the very least have the chance to climb the ranks of this society.” Srgious hangs his head down. “But there is no redemption, there is no recourse, the only option seems to be to end this life and start another.” The cleric reveals a small dirk from his hand and contemplates it. </p>

                <p>“What must I do?” Srgious pleads to the entity before him. </p>

                <p>“Before you appease the gods you must exhaust yourself in prayer. To cleanse yourself of aspirations, and create a vulnerable space in your temple for the gods to visit. Then on the following sun, pray on an item blessed by each of the eight in their respective Temuairian temples. This will call their intent towards you. They will pass judgment on you and your deeds. Failing this will grant you their ire, succeeding will grant you their favor. Take that judgment to your kingdom’s figurehead, and from there the will of the mundanes shall answer you.” As Deoch speaks these last words so too does the flames around him dissipate into the past, soon followed by his avatar. Srgious bows his head, then in a flash…</p>

                <p>The aisling jolts awake. He looks around, only to find Deoch’s shrine empty.</p>
                
                <p>“Was it all a dream?” He asks himself. An itch gnaws at his palm and he rubs it. The unusual texture makes him draw his attention to it, where he discovers a red, sore indentation. He breathes and steadies himself. Then walks towards the exit.</p>
